                  <p class="lead">
                    Sometime in 1820, Allen Butler was born on a small farm in Frederick County Maryland at a place called 
                    Broad Run. As an enslaved person his parentage or birth was not recorded and there is little record of his 
                    life until he was 33 years old. On March 15th, 1852, the <a href= "http://mdhmapping.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Frederick-County-Manumissions-1748-1867.pdf">Frederick County 
                      </a> manumission records note that Allen was freed from Margaret Biser. Later a local <a href="./images/butler_once_a_slave.png">newspaper</a> would report 
                      that Allen was sold to John Schindler. While this could be true, it appears that Allen was set free and moved 
                      with John Schindler to Ohio. Regardless, <a href= "https://www-jstor-org.proxyeast.uits.iu.edu/stable/4246165?seq=6#metadata_info_tab_contents">Maryland law</a> 
                      required a manumitted slave to leave the state and if he was still enslaved when he got to Ohio, he was free either way. 
                      John Schindler was a German born minister whose daughter had married a nephew of Margaret Biser.  In Ohio, Allen Butler and 
                      John Schindler lived side by side. John's son Daniel would marry Allen to Mariah Conway on <a href ="./images/marriage.png">Nov 10th, 1854</a>, in 
                      Clark County Ohio. Sometime after 1860, Allen Butler moved to Illinois and by 1870 he had become quite prosperous, 
                      showing an estate worth $3200, comparable to his white neighbors. He and Mariah also have three children William, 
                      Harriet, and Oscar.

          <h4 class="mt-0 fw-bold">The Death of Allen Butler</h4>
          <p class="lead">
              In addition to a person's life, one of the greatest things that is lost in a lynching is the truth. It is likely that the 
              exact facts of Allen Butler's death will never be known. What is undeniable is that at some point in the early hours of 
              July 13, 1893, Allen Butler was found hanged in a tree in Lawrence County, Illinois. The earliest reports note that a 
              mob of hundreds of men were seen near the location. These reports would change as time went on claiming that Butler 
              committed suicide. The charge made against Butler was that he had performed an abortion for a young white woman who 
              worked for him. His son, William, was also accused and arrested. News reports would later claim that William was 
              responsible for the pregnancy and some reports would also claim that Allen (72 years old) was possibly the father of 
              the women's child as well. Most of the news reports would note that Allen was very wealthy.

          <h4 class="mt-0 fw-bold">The Allen Butler Estate</h4>
          <p class="lead">
            After the death of Allen Butler, his son William was ultimately released from jail and all charges were dropped against him. 
            His wife Mariah and two other childred immediately fled to Ohio. At some point, there are reports that William returned to 
            Illinois to sell some items, but he was never seen or heard of again. In an interesting complication, a lawsuit would be 
            filed by John H. Butler for control of Allen's estate. When Allen left Maryland for Ohio, he left behind a wife and three 
            children. In 1841, Allen had married a free woman of color, Mary House. With Mary he produced 4 children, one dying in infancy. One child, Robert, would join the 39th United States Colored Infantry Regiment. His unit participated in the “Crater” at Petersburg. He would be wounded several days later and ultimately die after several months in the hospital. His son John and former wife Mary would file claims against Oscar and Mariah for control of John’s estate. After a win in the lower court, John’s lawsuit would be overturned by the Illinois Supreme Court. Despite Mary being free and having had a marriage 
            in a church and producing four children, the court ruled the marriage of a person under slavery did not exist under the law.
