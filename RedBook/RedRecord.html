                          group of three black businessmen, Thomas Moss, Calvin McDowell, and Henry Stewart, 
                          operated the People’s Grocery Company. In March 1892, a mob of white men, possibly incited by a 
                          owner of a competing grocery, entered People’s and attacked the owners. While defending themselves 
                          and their place of business, several white men were injured during an exchange of gunfire. The 
                          three men were arrested and placed in jail. Several days later a 
                          mob attacked the jail and drug the three men out where they were shot and killed. 
                          Thomas Collins was a friend of Ida. B. Wells.

                        After the death of her friend, Ida used her position as editor and co-owner of the newspaper The Free Speech and Headlight 
                        to speak out against the crime. This action resulted in a white mob descending upon her office and destroying it and threatening 
                        her to never return to the city of Memphis again. However, Ms. Wells did not back down. Her response would be to scientifically 
                        analyze these incidents and revolutionize the field of journalism. It may be hard to believe today, but even white progressives 
                        believed that lynching was <a href = "https://www.hullhousemuseum.org/hullhouse-blog/2022/3/1/ida-b-wells-draft#:~:text=On%20the%20topic%20of%20lynching,in%20which%20she%20condemned%20lynching."">justified.</a>

                        In 1895, Ms. Wells published <em>A Red Record</em>. This 100 page pamphlet went into detail on cases of lynching across the US. 
                        With 14 pages of statistics, 
                        she provided ample evidence of the extent of the use of lynching across the US. This was particularly suprising to many in the North, 
                        as her data shows the majority of lynching occured in the South. However, lynching did not just occur in the South. The visualization below

                                <p>A WHITE WOMAN'S FALSEHOOD</p>
                                <p>
                                "The Cleveland, Ohio, Gazette, January 16, 1892, gives an account of one of these cases of "rape."
                                Mrs. J.C. Underwood, the wife of a minister of Elyria, Ohio, accused an Afro-American of rape. She told her husband that during his absence in 1888, stumping the 
                                state for the Prohibition Party, the man came to the kitchen door, forced his way in the house and insulted her. She tried to drive him out with a heavy poker, 
                                but he overpowered and chloroformed her, and when she revived her clothing was torn and she was in a horrible condition. She did not know the man, but could i
                                dentify him. She subsequently pointed out William Offett, a married man, who was arrested, and, being in Ohio, was granted a trial.
                                The prisoner vehemently denied the charge of rape, but confessed he went to Mrs. Underwood's residence at her invitation and was criminally intimate with her at 
                                her request. This availed him nothing against the sworn testimony of a minister's wife, a lady of the highest respectability. He was found guilty, and entered the penitentiary, December 14, 1888, for fifteen years. Sometime afterwards the woman's remorse led her to confess to her husband that the man was innocent. These are her words: "I met Offett at the postoffice. It was raining. He was polite to me, and as I had several bundles in my arms he offered to carry them home for me, which he did. He had a strange fascination for me, and I invited him to call on me. He called, bringing chestnuts and candy for the children. By this means we got them to leave us alone in the room. Then I sat on his lap. He made a proposal to me and I readily consented. Why I did so I do not know, but that I did is true. He visited me several times after that and each time I was indiscreet. I did not care after the first time. In fact I could not have resisted, and had no desire to resist."
                                When asked by her husband why she told him she had been outraged, she said: "I had several reasons for telling you. One was the neighbors saw the fellow here, 
                                another was, I was afraid I had contracted a loathsome disease, and still another was that I feared I might give birth to a Negro baby. I hoped to save my reputation by telling you a deliberate lie." Her husband, horrified by the confession, had Offett, who had already served four years, released and secured a divorce.
                                There have been many such cases throughout the South, with the difference that the Southern white men in insensate fury wreak their vengeance without 
                                intervention of law upon the Negro who consorts with their women."
