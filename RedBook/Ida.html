                            <h4 class="mt-0 fw-bold">Early Life</h4>
                            Ida Bell Wells was born on July 16th, 1862. Her father James and mother Elizabeth were enslaved to Spires Boling in 
                            Holly Springs, Mississippi. After emancipation, her father began a carpentry business and became engaged in politics to 
                            support the Republican part. Her father became a trustee of Shaw College and Ida would later attend there. In 1878, Ida’s 
                            mother, father, and one of her younger siblings were killed in a yellow fever epidemic. Ida, along with another relative, 
                            stepped in to raise her younger siblings. She took a job as a teacher at an elementary school and her grandmother helped to 
                            watch over the family while she was teaching. In 1880, her grandmother died, and Ida moved to Memphis with her younger 
                            siblings.
                            <h4 class="mt-0 fw-bold">Memphis Years</h4>
                            Ms. Wells began teaching in Memphis and increasingly writing for local newspapers. In 1884, She refused to give up her 
                            seat on a railroad car and was forcibly removed. Suing the railroad company, she initially won, only to have her case 
                            overturned by the Tennessee Supreme Court. Her writing and activism increased during this period, eventually causing 
                            her to be fired from her teaching position after she criticized the Board of Education. In 1889, one of her friends was 
                            killed by a white mob. This began her campaign against lynching. Her writing against this event would cause her newspaper 
                            offices to be destroyed and threats to be placed against her life. During this time, she performed statistical analysis of
                             white mob violence and produced multiple pamphlets with her findings. Her work was some of the first data-based journalism 
                             and it firmly 
                            established that much of the mob violence against African Americans was without cause and in some cases pre-planned. 
                            <h4 class="mt-0 fw-bold">Chicago Years</h4>
                            Ida married Ferdinand Barnett in 1895. Barnett was a widower with two children. She would eventually have four children with 
                            Barnett. Ferdinand was also a prominent Chicago attorney and like Ida, an activist and journalist. Ida continued advocating 
                            for civil rights and began to become involved in the suffragist movement. While in Chicage, she also protested efforts to segregate the school system.
                            She rose in prominence in the civil rights movement 
                            and has had an enduring legacy for her work and journalism.
